                    "Ram was born in a small village in Haryana. From a humble family, but with a grand dream — to bring honor to his family and elevate his community. <br />

                    Since childhood, Ram was lively and curious. Questions often arose in his mind: <br />
                    'Why do we in the villages remain uneducated while city dwellers get jobs?' <br />
                    This curiosity never let him rest. <br />

                    At the age of 12, the pressure to study increased. The village school was just a makeshift room — the roof leaked, and the walls were filled with dust. But Ram didn't give up. <br />

                    He swore to never stop studying. Books were borrowed from his elder brother — expensive textbooks were lent to him by the clerk. <br />

                    His daily routine became: working in the fields during the day and studying in the evening." <br />

                    "One day, a team of SSC teachers visited the village. <br /> They identified the local meritorious students, and Ram's name was among them. <br /> He began receiving scholarships and coaching services. <br />

                    This was the fruit of Ram's hard work. Now, the village was learning from city coaching centers, but Ram's dedication never wavered."

                    After completing his degree, Ram returned to the village. The villagers asked, <br />
                    “Why didn’t you take a job in the city?”<br />
                    Ram smiled and replied, <br />
                    “Yes... but my work is here.” <br />
                    He started the ‘Information and Inspiration Center’ — a place for children and youth to learn and grow. <br />
                    Initially, there was resistance: <br />
                    “What’s this new trick?” <br />
                    “What can a servant teach?” <br />
                    But Ram kept smiling, for within him was an unwavering belief. <br />

                    “Local teachers rose in opposition, and some villagers tried to shut the center down. <br />
                    Ram himself lacked basic resources—electricity, sanitation, and a proper study environment were all in short supply. <br />

                    Yet he did not give up: <br />

                    He organized a village‑city fair, showing villagers the value of education. <br />

                    Children showcased their talents—poems, dramas, songs—and the village people were won over. <br />

                    Ram’s struggle bore fruit: a wave of education swept through the village, bringing a new hope.” <br />

                    “Articles appeared in newspapers about Ram’s story, and it sparked conversations across social media. <br />
                    With government support, the village underwent transformation: <br />
                    – Electricity was brought inscri <br />
                    – Digital classrooms were launched <br />
                    – A library was built <br />

                    News spread far and wide about Ram’s “Inspiration Center,” and soon others began adopting his model. <br />
                    The story became symbolic of how rural education can evolve through grassroots effort and official support, mirroring initiatives like digital classrooms and library setups in thousands of Indian government schools under national programmes <br />

                    “Ram went on to open centers in two nearby villages as well. Young people received certificates and secured new jobs from those centers. <br />
                    Then the turn came for the cities — large organizations, educational institutions, and development foundations began to recognize and endorse the effort. <br />

                    Ram’s uplifting messages were: <br />
                    ‘Every son and daughter should receive an education.’<br />
                    ‘Education is not just for employment—it’s for thinking in a new way.’<br />

                    This message resonated far and wide and became a powerful echo.”<br />

                    Now Ram’s village has become a model inspiration center. <br />
                    Students gain computer skills,<br />
                    And writing in urban languages has improved greatly. <br />
                    Education from the village now reaches across the district and state. <br />

                    Ram’s story has become one of legend: <br />
                    ‘A child from a small village, with a grand vision and even greater courage.’ <br />

                    He steps onto platforms and says proudly: <br />
                    ‘My village, my family — they are my inspiration. <br />
